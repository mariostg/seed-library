        <p>The Ottawa Wildflower Seed Library (OWSL) uses <a target="_blank" href="https://data.canadensys.net/vascan/search">VASCAN</a> to determine the correct names of species. We only accept species native to Ontario, as determined by VASCAN. As a result, the catalogue only includes plants that are determined by VASCAN as native to Ontario.
